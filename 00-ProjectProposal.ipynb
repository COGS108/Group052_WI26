    "Basketball is a high intensity, physically demanding sport played professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA), where teams compete in an 82-game regular season typically running from October to April. Each NBA team plays almost daily, often traveling long distances between cities. Over a season, this results in periods of “schedule congestion”, including back-to-back games, where a team plays on consecutive days and games with varying amounts of rest and recovery in between. Performance in these games is usually measured using team-level statistics such as points scored, field goal percentage (FG%), turnovers and the win/loss outcome, as well as more nuanced metrics like net efficiency, effective field goal percentage (an adjusted shooting measure accounting for three-point shots) and pace of play. These metrics provide insight into both offensive and defensive performance in comparison across games and conditions.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1), <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "One specific scheduling feature of interest is the occurrence of back-to-back games, defined as games played by the same team on consecutive days without a full day of rest in between. Back-to-back games are often viewed as particularly challenging because players have limited time for physical recovery and travel between contests. Sports science and basketball analytics suggests that short rest intervals may lead to accumulated fatigue, which can negatively affect shooting efficiency, decision-making and defensive performance.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Moreover, a more closely related prior research on NBA performance metrics has examined which game-related statistics are most strongly associated with winning outcomes in NBA competition.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) The research analyzed nearly 4,000 NBA games across multiple seasons and found that field goal percentage and overall shooting efficiency were among the most important variables distinguishing winning and losing teams. The study also observed that teams tend to adopt more conservative styles of play under higher pressure conditions, resulting in changes to points scored and turnover rates. These findings suggest that commonly used performance metrics such as FG%, points scored, and turnovers are meaningful indicators of team success and provide a strong foundation for analyzing how external factors, such as rest and scheduling, may influence performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to academic research, prior student-led data science projects have explored NBA performance statistics using approaches that are closely related to the project proposed here. A recent university capstone project<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) analyzed an NBA Player Performance Statistics dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains player-level and team-level performance metrics such as points scored, shooting percentages, rebounds, assists and turnovers across multiple seasons. Similar to our project, this work relied on publicly available NBA data and used exploratory data analysis and visualizations to understand how basketball performance metrics relate to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project investigated relationships between different offensive and performance variables, including patterns of playing style, the association between two-point field goal production and player experience and the relationship between age and three-point scoring. Their findings indicated that player experience is positively associated with two-point scoring output, while the relationship between age and three-point production is not strictly linear. Importantly, the authors emphasized that NBA performance is influenced by multiple interacting variables, highlighting the value of examining several performance metrics together rather than relying on a single statistic. While this prior project focused on player-level characteristics, its methodology and use of NBA performance statistics are relevant to our work. Our project would most likely adopt a similar data-driven and exploratory approach but shifts the unit of analysis to the team and game level, examining how performance metrics differ under different rest conditions, specifically back-to-back games versus games with at least one day of rest. In this way, our analysis builds directly on similar analytical techniques while addressing a distinct and complementary research question within NBA analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research and applied analytics have established that several game-level performance metrics(points scored, field goal percentage, turnovers and rebounding) are strongly associated with winning outcomes in NBA competition. Studies have also demonstrated that contextual factors, including player workload, travel demands and schedule density, influence both physical fatigue and on court decision making. In the same way, demographic and experience-related factors(age, minutes played, and games played) have been shown to correlate with certain aspects of performance, particularly shooting efficiency and scoring output. Together, this body of work suggests that NBA performance is shaped by a combination of tactical choices, player characteristics and external constraints related to scheduling and recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite this existing knowledge, explicit comparisons of team-level performance across different rest conditions remain relatively underexplored, particularly using a consistent set of game-level statistics. Much of the prior work focuses either on identifying which performance metrics predict winning or on player-level characteristics such as age and experience, rather than isolating the role of rest availability itself. Fewer studies systematically compare how the same core performance metrics differ between games played on consecutive days and games played with additional rest, even though back-to-back games are a common and structurally important feature of the NBA schedule. This gap motivates our present project. In this study, we treat rest condition, specifically back-to-back games versus games with at least one full day of rest, while also exploring how other team-level performance metrics relate to game outcomes. This approach builds on existing research by focusing directly on scheduling-related factors, while still allowing for exploratory analysis of other relevant performance metrics. Overall, this project represents a logical next step in NBA performance analysis and helps connect prior work on game statistics and scheduling factors to a data-driven research question.\n",
